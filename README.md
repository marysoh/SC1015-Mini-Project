# SC1015-Mini-Project

## [DSF2 - Group 10] SC1015 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence


<br> In this project, we will be modelling a Linear Regression model based off a series of Predictor variables (which will be listed below) to determine a response of our choice.

For the project, we will be using a dataset from Kaggle: **YouTuber Saying Things** by Pranesh Mukhopadhyay.

We aim to help advertisers and marketing firms determine whom they should invest in to promote their goods and/or services using the following predictors:

 - Length of Title of Video <br>
 - Number of Subscribers <br>
 - Length of Video <br>

To determine which YouTubers provide the highest return of investment, we will use **Views** to quantify the outreach of the advertisment to users on YouTube. Id est, advertisers and marketing firms should invest in YouTubers that generates the highest the number of views in their videos as it the outreach for their advertisments are greater.

## Problem Definition
How do the different variables affect a video's view count to maximise advertiser's customer reach?


## Models Used
- Multi-Variate Linear Regression
- Uni-Variate Linear Regression
- Classification tree


## Conclusion
-There is a strong relationship between the variables: subscribers, length of video and length of title, and the predictor views. This is true for most categories, except for Video Games, Informative, News and Comedy.
-In general, the number of subscribers of a channel has a strong relationship with the average number of views per video created by the channel.
-Advertisers should choose to sponsor videos from YouTubers with higher subscriber counts in order to get more views and hence maximise customer reach.
