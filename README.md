# SC1015-Mini-Project

## [DSF2 - Group 10] SC1015 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence


<br> In this project, we will be modelling a Linear Regression model based off a series of Predictor variables (which will be listed below) to determine a response of our choice.

For the project, we will be using a dataset from Kaggle: **YouTuber Saying Things** by Pranesh Mukhopadhyay.
